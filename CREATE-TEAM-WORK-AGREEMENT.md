# Create a Team Working Agreement

A Team Working Agreement is a flexible, enforceable, and co-created document that establishes your teamâ€™s development processes and the guidelines that surround it. 

## How to use this file
Clone this repository and use this file as a starting point for your team. You can follow the steps make sense for your team and skip the ones that don't! By the end of this exercise, you should have a formalized document that contains your team's agreed upon terms.


### Step 1. Plan out some dedicated meetings to discuss your team's code review process (or lack thereof), coding conventions from past experience, and any other topics related to how your team will facilitate code reviews.
Keep in mind that this may take more than a few meetings! As you set some dates, be sure to give everyone ample time to prepare and encourage everyone, juniors, seniors, code writers, code reviewers...to participate!

TODO: {Find a good time for everyone to meet}

### Step 2. During your meetings, start listing out the things your team agrees on first! This way, you have some material to start with and can build upon it.

What Do We Agree On?

TODO (Fill out these sections as appropriate. Add your own sections too!):

Coding Conventions
  - Naming
  - Formatting
  - Style Guide
  - Architectural patterns

Code Review Process
  - List out steps, from beginning to end
  - Automated tests? Builds?
  - Minimum Number of Reviewers?
  - Branch Policies
  - Emergency Deploy process?
  - Codeowners (who should be auto-added to reviews, based on part of project that's changed?)

### Step 3. Once you've listed most of what you agree on, it's time to discuss what you don't agree on. You can use the same list as above, but for each item that has differing opinions, it could help to also list the pros and cons of each method/philosophy/convention.
Having these laid out in a comparable format should make it easier for everyone to see and come to their own conclusion.

Comparison Matrix (Fill out this matrix for each item/convention/thing that your team disagrees on. Give each person the time and space to explain their case and to list out their supporting arguments on this matrix.

Pros | Cons | Team Experience with item | Estimated Learning Curve (if applicable) | Platform Support (if applicable)
