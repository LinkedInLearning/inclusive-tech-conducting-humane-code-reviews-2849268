This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course `[Conducting Humane Code Reviews]`. The full course is available from [LinkedIn Learning](https://linkedin.com/learning/).

This course will explore the common mistakes to avoid while performing a code review, the unwanted side effects that can occur because of them, and best practices to consider when performing code reviews. By the end of this course, learners should be able to conduct code reviews fairly, catch substantiated mistakes, make productive suggestions, and still like (and be liked by) their teammates after the process.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02-03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.
